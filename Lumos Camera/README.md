Take photos with your friends, guests, or colleagues and view them live on a TV, beamer, or simply on your MacBook so everyone can see them.

Lumos is the perfect photo app for your wedding, birthday, corporate event, or other celebration where lots of photos are taken.

Photos are transferred directly to the Server via the local network (WLAN).

In the future, there will also be a cloud connection that will no longer connect you to a local network or Mac.
